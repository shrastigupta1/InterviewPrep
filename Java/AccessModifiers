Access Modifiers are those modifiers that are used to restrict the visibility of classes, fields, methods, and constructors.

Private:
1. Private access modifier in Java can apply to a variable, method, constructor, inner class but not to the class itself.
2. The instance variable can be private but a local variable cannot be private.
3. If we make any constructor as private, we cannot create an object of that class from another class and also cannot create the subclass of that class.

Default Access Modifier:
1. Default members of a class are visible inside of the class and everywhere within classes in the same package only.

Protected Access Modifier:
1. Protected members are accessible inside the class and everywhere within classes in the same package and outside the package but through inheritance only.

Public Access Modifier in Java:
1. Public access modifier can apply to instance variables, constructors, inner classes, outer class, methods but not with local variables.
2. Public members of a class can be used anywhere.
